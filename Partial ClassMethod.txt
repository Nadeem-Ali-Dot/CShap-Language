Partial Class/Method 
------------------------
Partial Class:-
------------------
ðŸ§© What is a Partial Class in C#?

>>A partial class in C# allows you to split the definition of a class, struct, or interface across multiple files. At compile time, all the parts are combined into a single class.

This feature is useful for:
----------------------------
>> Keeping large classes manageable
>> Separating auto-generated code from custom logic
>> Working in team environments where multiple developers can edit different parts of the same class

public partial class Person
{
    public string FirstName { get; set; }
    public string LastName { get; set; }
}

public partial class Person
{
    public string GetFullName()
    {
        return $"{FirstName} {LastName}";
    }
}
------------------------------------------
Partial Method :-
------------------
>> Inside partial class we create partial method.
>> Partial method has no definition, definition can be defined other partial class.
>> Partial method has no return type. (void)
>> by default partial method has private.
